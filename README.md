# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the Project
###Background
Perform an analysis on all the rideshare data for PyBer, from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize.

###Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, this report includes multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type.

###Results
The PyBer Summary Dataframe gives you a comparison of PyBer’s ridesharing services in three city types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban cities. The figure below shows that there is a higher demand for ridesharing in urban cities in comparison to suburban and rural cities.

We can also see on the figure below that there was a higher volume of drivers in urban cities when compared to suburban and rural cities.

Since there is a higher demand for PyBer in urban cities, the total fares are also higher then suburban and rural cities. From the figure below you can can see that most PyBer’s revenue came from urban cities.

As you can see on the chart below, the fare is more expensive in rural areas then urban cities, with suburban falling in between by about $5 to $6 dollars.

The “Total Fare by City Type” multiple-line chart provides further information on total fares in rural, suburban and urban cities, between January 2019 and April 2019. The yellow line shows that urban fares stayed right above the $2000 price. While suburban line stayed close to the $1000 price. Last is the rural line which stayed right underneath the $500 dollar mark.

###Summary: 

PyBer has a higher rate in ridesharing clients in urban cities. There are more drivers in urban cities then in rural and suburban. Drivers in rural cities earn more the drivers in urban cities. This could discourage drivers from wanting to work in urban or suburban cities. Overall, PyBer ridesharing services differ in rural, urban and suburban cities given the fares, rides and drivers. This data shows that there is a higher demand for PyBer’s ridesharing services in urban cities.
